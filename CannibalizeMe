#Alek's code from the initial joining and processing of the Darmanis human cortex single-cell RNAseq data:

#I think this is scrap code
#test<-read.table(file = "GSM1657871_1772078217.C03.csv")
#rm(test)

SampleInfo<-read.csv("SampleInfo_forR.csv", header=T, colClasses ="character")

#Loading all of the separate files representing the RNAseq data for each cell into the R workspace and creating an object representing each of them:
Rename<-list.files()#must remove everything except for darmanis files for the code to run this step
for (i in 1:length(Rename)) assign(paste("",Rename[i], sep = ""), read.table(Rename[i]))
rm(Rename)
rm(i)

library(plyr)
ls()

#I think this is scrap code
#i=3

Allobjects<-ls()

#Taking all of the objects representing the RNASeq data for individual cells and combining them into a single data matrix. Note that the only reason this code works is because: 1) there were only 2 other objects in the workspace 2) the RNAseq data for each cell is in an identical format - same length, same genes, same order. Otherwise, we would have needed to use a join function instead of cbind.


JoinedDarmanis<-cbind(GSM1657871_1772078217.C03.csv[,2],GSM1657872_1772078217.C04.csv[,2])
colnames(JoinedDarmanis)[c(1:2)]<-c("GSM1657871_1772078217.C03.csv", "GSM1657872_1772078217.C04.csv")

for(i in 3:length(Allobjects)){
  
JoinedDarmanis<-cbind(JoinedDarmanis, (get(Allobjects[i])[,2]))
colnames(JoinedDarmanis)[i]<-(Allobjects)[i]

}
